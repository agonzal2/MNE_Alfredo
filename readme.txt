This is my MNE analysis for spectral analysis with EEG and epilepsy data.


For stuff with depth delectrodes first use main_script_openephys_mne.py 
followed by create_MNE_data.py

For stuff for 32 channel skull electrode, Ingrid's work, use main_script_openephys_mne_EEG_probe.py
followed by MNE_data_EEG_probe.
